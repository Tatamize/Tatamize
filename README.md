<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Hello! 

Thank you for visiting :smiley:.  
I'm Keiko, a software engineering student at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/)  \(a [42](https://www.42network.org/) Network coding school\) located in Amsterdam.  

I enjoy coding / creating / crafting / designing. Development is fun.

These repositories are for school projects, and for my experiments.

I'm trying to switch my career from a Web designer to a software engineer / full-stack engineer.   
My portfolio as a Web designer is [here](https://portfolio-interesta.netlify.app/).

I'm glad to hear from you!
